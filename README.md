Orwellian-Fantasy
=================

Orwellian Fantasy is a hypertext game project. This repository is mainly for organizing ideas and keeping track of the project.

Inspirations
============

- Nineteen Eighty-Four
- Brazil
- Ultra Business Tycoon III (http://aliendovecote.com/uploads/twine/tycoon/crime.html)

Want to contribute?
===================

I'm open to suggestions, ideas, and critisism; it's part of why I created this repository. You can leave suggestions in the issue tracker (https://github.com/VampyreLord/Orwellian-Fantasy/issues), and once I create the game files you can look into those and add to them by sending a pull request.

How to get the game
===================

If you are interested, I can send the "work-in-progress" version I'm currently working on; if you can wait until I release a version here, it's much better.

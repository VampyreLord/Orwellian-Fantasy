Want to contribute?
===================

I'm open to suggestions, ideas, and critisism; it's part of why I created this repository. You can leave suggestions in the [issue tracker](https://github.com/VampyreLord/Orwellian-Fantasy/issues), and once I create the game files you can clone the repository and edit them by sending a pull request.

How to get the game

In the mean time, there is no release but an alpha release will be available soon.
